2025-05-07 13:31:55.696 GMT [1] LOG:  skipping missing configuration file "/var/lib/postgresql/17/main/postgresql.auto.conf"
2025-05-07 13:31:55.696 UTC [1] FATAL:  data directory "/var/lib/postgresql/17/main" has wrong ownership
2025-05-07 13:31:55.696 UTC [1] HINT:  The server must be started by the user that owns the data directory.


Now we have the exact error! The PostgreSQL container is failing to start with:

FATAL: data directory "/var/lib/postgresql/17/main" has wrong ownership
HINT: The server must be started by the user that owns the data directory.

This is an ownership issue. Despite the init-permissions container running chown -R 999:999, there still seems to be a mismatch. This can happen when the PostgreSQL image expects different user IDs or when the volume mounting doesn't preserve the right permissions.
Let's fix this by modifying our StatefulSet:

First, let's add a more robust init container that ensures the permissions are correctly set:
